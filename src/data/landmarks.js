      "Mestia is located in the Svaneti region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti province (mkhare), some 128 kilometres (80 miles) northeast of the regional capital of Zugdidi. Mestia and the adjoining 132 villages form Mestia District (raioni). Its area is 3,044 square kilometres (1,175 sq mi); and its population is 9,316 (1,973 in the town itself), according to the 2014 Georgia census. It was granted the status of a townlet (Georgian: daba) in 1968.Historically and ethnographically, Mestia has always been regarded a chief community of Zemo, or Upper Svaneti province. It was formerly known as Seti (სეტი). The population is mostly Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of the Georgians. Despite its small size, the townlet was an important centre of Georgian culture for centuries and contains a number of medieval monuments, such as churches and forts, included in a list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Mestia is served by the Queen Tamar Airport, which is operated by the state-owned company United Airports of Georgia, since 2010.",

Alternatively, you can opt to drive the route from Tbilisi along the Georgian Military Highway yourself and stay overnight in Stepantsminda town, allowing you get up early to beat the crowds and catch the morning sun glistening off Trinity Church. You’re sure to work up a hunger during the climb, so be sure to stop over in Stepantsmida on your way back for some delicious Georgian khachapuri to fill you up.",

No wonder that Georgia’s Kakheti region is quickly becoming famous for serving up some of best — and most affordable — wine in the world. Not to mention, it’s one of the most beautiful places to visit in Georgia in its own right. The most popular way to tour Kakheti’s many wineries is as part of an organized day trip from Tbilisi. I suggest this full-day group wine tour, which has over 100 great reviews and is super affordable to boot.If you have more time, you can can opt to soak in the region’s gorgeous landscapes by spending a few nights exploring the many villages and towns in this large region. If you’re not a wine lover, you can still visit the 6th century David Gareja monastery complex, one of the more popular places to visit in Georgia Europe.",

One of the oldest settlements in Georgia, the “cave city” of Uplistiskhe was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Kartli, and fascinating for the fact that it was later a place where Christians and pagans co-lived together. If you’re traveling to the western part of Georgia, Uplistiskhe makes a great attraction to break up the drive.
